                <dt>The Last Unicorn By Peter S. Beagle</dt> <br>
                <dd> Growing up, this movie was my all time favorite. And it still very much is. To this day, I still believe that it has shaped the way I move and function in the world. <br> <br> While I've never read the book (I didn't know it existed in the first place), I found this story to be captivating because of the art style and the colors and the theme that this movie took on. <br> <br> The movie, directed by Arthut Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass, has inspired me to take up writing fiction in the hopes that one day I, too, can write a memorable story that moves lives.  </dd>
</dl>.

        <h3 class="section one" id="section1">The Beninging</h3>
        <dfn> The story starts out with a two hunters going about their day in the forest, looking for game. One the hunters sees the deepness of the forest and asks what's in there. The second hunter replies by saying, "There be unicorns in there. At least, there used to be. Now there's only one, and she is the last of her kind."</dfn>
        <p>Having over heard this conversation the last unicorn begins to doubt that last statement. She can't be the last. It can't be possible. So, she wanders her side of the forest where are the kind and loving creatures are and seeks out a butterfly in hopes of getting an answer.</p>
        <p>She finds this butterfly and asks him questions but replies in riddles and jests. But the most important thing that the butterfly says is to find the Red Bull (I promise it's not the drink).</p>

        
        <h2 class="section two" id="section2">The Development</h2>
        <sub>The last unicorn then travels for some time through the ocuntry side and through strange ways meets two people: a magician and a woman with a group of misfits.</sub>
        <p>Although the woman does sees the unicorn, she is not happy. She claims that she is forsaken and that it's the unicorn's fault for not being around when she needed here most. The magician consoles her and tells the woman not to fret and they, him and the unicorn are on a journey to find the rest of the unicorns. This is where the woman begs to come along with and is permitted to go with them.
     </p>

<h2 class="section three" id="section3">The Twist</h2>

 <p>The group travels to the castle where the magician told them that the king, King Hagard, has kept all the unicorns. How he took his Red Bull and commanded the beast to drive heach and every unicorn into the ocean. He did this because he saw that they were beautiful in their immortality and purity. He wanted all of them to himself. <br><br> And upon entering the land the Red Bull finds the unicorn and begins to drive he into the sea. The woman begs the magician to do something to save the magician. He asks the magic to aid him and succeeds in turning the unicorn into a woman. <br> <br> No longer is she immortal and pure, she feels death surround her and her flesh aging. She begins claiming that it was better for her to have been driven into the ocean than become a human.
     </p>

<h2 class="section four" id="section4">The END</h2>

 <p>As the movie begins to wrap up, she finally has to face off against the bull as she can now see that this human experience has dulled her senses and in doing so robbed her of her mission. To combat this, she follows the advice of the one-eyed-cat and walks through the clock. King Hagardis then alerted by his skeleton who says, "UNICORN! UNICORN!" after realizing she wasn't human in the first place. Amalthea, the last unicorn, shape shifts into her original form and is then chased by the Red Bull into the ocean.<br> <br> Prince Leer, who loves Amalthea, protects her and is ultimately killed in the process. Having learned what love is, The Last Unicorn defends his dead body and pushes the Red Bull into the ocean, which frees all of her kind. All the unicorns trample over the castle and it comes crumbling down, killing King Hargard in the process. <br><br> After returning to the beach, where Prince Leer was slain, she beings him back to life with the touch of her horn.<br><br> Timeskip <br><br> She has return to her forest and the group disbands. Everyone lives happily ever after. More or less.  </p>
